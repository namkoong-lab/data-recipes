How do we interpret a test loss of 0.03? I assume this is MSE. Can you also calculate R^2 or think about ways to contextualize which predictive performance we would deem to be faithful? e.g., we want to discriminate bad vs. good data mixtures from the predictions so we might be able to design a simple measure of predictive utility

2. Given the typical scaling laws, are there transformations of the outcomes that you think would be natural for MLPs to predict? e.g., logs

56
3. With these transformations, do we expect a sharp phase transition in predictive abilities beyond a certain range?


2 Analysis:
1. Do R^2, etc. Metrics that define the predictive utility of the datamodel.

2. Whether the prediction smoothly interpolates between inputs. For now, let's focus on just size, since that is mostly what people care about, whether small model runs can help predict large model runs. 




Ok im not sure if it R2 makes sense.

So what I want to know is how good of a fit of my model is on the different tests, which I have 11 of.

Issue is these 11 tests are independent and are not the same.
So R^2 is meaningless across these tests. 

But R^2 



1. **Simple R²** :
- One input variable (x)
- One output variable (y)
- Measures how well a simple linear relationship fits

2. **Multiple R²** (what we're using):
- Multiple input variables (x₁, x₂, ..., x₉ in your case)
- One output variable (y)
- Measures how well all input variables together explain the output

In your case, for each output metric (like CommonCrawl loss), the R² tells you:
"How well do all 9 features together explain the variation in this metric?"

For example:
```python
# For CommonCrawl loss:
X = [
    # Each row has all 9 features
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 20, 256, 8, 1000],    # LM 1
    [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 60, 512, 16, 2000],   # LM 2
    [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 150, 1024, 32, 3000], # LM 3
]

y_commoncrawl = [2.1, 1.9, 1.7]  # True losses
y_pred_commoncrawl = [2.0, 1.95, 1.65]  # Predicted losses

r2 = r2_score(y_commoncrawl, y_pred_commoncrawl)
```

The R² here measures how well your MLP, using all 9 input features, can predict the CommonCrawl loss. It's not about the relationship with any single feature, but rather the predictive power of all features combined!

This is why R² is useful for your multi-feature prediction task, even though you have more than one input variable.


Two questions:
1. Training on smaller model sizes (<= 500MM), what is the predictive loss on larger model size?
2. Training across trainsteps but with normalization, does it work fine now? Was it a normalization issue all along?
3. What is the best way to normalize the data? (min-max, z-score, unit norm, etc.)
    - SKLearn has normalization functions.
